Given input strings Text and Pattern as well as an integer d, we extend the definition of PatternCount to the function ApproximatePatternCount(Pattern, Text, d). This function computes the number of occurrences of Pattern in Text with at most d mismatches. For example,\n",

Although the minimum of the skew diagram for E. coli is found at position 3923620, we should not assume that its ori is found exactly at this position due to random fluctuations in the skew. To remedy this issue, we could choose a larger window size (e.g., 1000), but expanding the window introduces the risk that we may bring in other clumped 9-mers that do not represent DnaA boxes but appear in this window more often than the true DnaA box. It makes more sense to try a small window either starting, ending, or centered at the position of minimum skew.\n",
